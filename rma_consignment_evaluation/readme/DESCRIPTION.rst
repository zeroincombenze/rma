This module allows you to create a RMA from sale order,
both for return both for sale.

RMA for sale moves product to Customer location and set quantity to invoice on
sale order lines.

RMA for return moves product to internal stock. Notice this behavior is different from
standard RMA which move products into specific RMA location.
